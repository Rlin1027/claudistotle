# Permissions Configuration Guide

This document explains the permission structure in `settings.json`.

## Permission Structure

### Default Mode
```json
"defaultMode": "default"
```
Prompts for approval on first use of each tool per session. Standard security mode.

### Deny Rules (Highest Priority)
```json
"deny": [
  "Bash(sudo *)",    // Prevent privilege escalation
  "Bash(dd *)",      // Prevent disk operations
  "Bash(mkfs *)"     // Prevent filesystem formatting
]
```
Explicitly blocks destructive operations for safety. These cannot be approved even if requested.

### Allow Rules (Auto-Approved)
```json
"allow": [
  "Read",            // Read any file
  "Grep",            // Search file contents
  "Glob",            // Find files by pattern
  "WebSearch",       // Search the web
  "WebFetch",        // Fetch web content
  "Bash",            // All Bash commands (see safety layers below)
  "Write(reviews/**)",  // Create files in reviews/ and subdirectories
  "Edit(reviews/**)",   // Edit files in reviews/ and subdirectories
  "Skill(literature-review)",      // Main orchestration skill
  "Skill(philosophy-research)"     // Academic search skill
]
```

**Why `Bash` (all commands)?** Individual prefix patterns like `Bash(python *)` or `Bash(REVIEW_DIR=*)` cannot match multi-line Bash scripts — the `*` wildcard doesn't cross newlines. Domain researcher subagents routinely run multi-line scripts (setting variables, then calling `$PYTHON`), causing persistent permission prompts. Using bare `Bash` allows all commands, but the `deny` and `ask` rules still provide safety (see evaluation order below).

### Ask Rules (Require Approval)
```json
"ask": [
  "Bash(rm *)",      // File deletion requires approval
  "Bash(rmdir *)"    // Directory deletion requires approval
]
```
Destructive file operations require user approval rather than being blocked entirely.

## Permission Evaluation Order

1. **Deny** rules are checked first (block completely)
2. **Ask** rules are checked next (require user approval)
3. **Allow** rules are checked last (auto-approve without prompt)

The first matching rule wins. So `Bash(sudo *)` in `deny` blocks sudo even though `Bash` is in `allow`. And `Bash(rm *)` in `ask` still prompts even though `Bash` is in `allow`.

## Security Layers

With `Bash` in the allow list, safety comes from three layers:

1. **Deny rules**: `sudo`, `dd`, `mkfs` are blocked unconditionally
2. **Ask rules**: `rm`, `rmdir` still require approval
3. **Scoped writes**: `Write` and `Edit` are only auto-approved in `reviews/`

## Hook Configuration

Beyond permissions, `settings.json` configures hooks that run automatically:

| Hook | Trigger | Script | Purpose |
|------|---------|--------|---------|
| SessionStart | Session begins | `setup-environment.sh` | Activate venv |
| PreToolUse (Write) | Before any Write tool call | `validate_bib_write.py` | Validate BibTeX syntax before writing `.bib` files |
| SubagentStop | After subagent finishes | `subagent_stop_bib.sh` | Validate BibTeX output from domain researchers |

## Agent-Specific Configuration

Agents specify `model` and `tools` in their frontmatter (see `agents/`):

| Agent | Model | Tools | Permission Mode |
|-------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| `domain-literature-researcher` | `sonnet` | Bash, Glob, Grep, Read, Write, WebFetch, WebSearch | `acceptEdits` |
| `synthesis-planner` | `inherit` | Glob, Grep, Read, Write | `acceptEdits` |
| `synthesis-writer` | `sonnet` | Glob, Grep, Read, Write | `acceptEdits` |
| `literature-review-planner` | `inherit` | Read, Write | `acceptEdits` |

Agents inherit the project-level `allow`/`deny`/`ask` rules from `settings.json`. The `Bash` allow rule is inherited by all subagents, so the `domain-literature-researcher` can run multi-line Bash scripts without prompts. The `deny` and `ask` rules are also inherited, maintaining safety.
